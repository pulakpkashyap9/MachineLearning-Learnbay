# MachineLearning-Learnbay
These are the Machine Learning algorithms that I have learned via Learn Bay.  This repository has all the files with the codes required for the alogorithms taught by Learn Bay
The files are as follows:
1. KNN with Cross Validation (Dataset: Classified Data)
2. KNN (Dataset: Iris)
3. Naive Bayes (Gaussian) with Grid Search CV (Dataset: Human Activity Recognition)
